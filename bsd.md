# Why is BSD not supported?
BSD is not **yet** supported, I havent really started working on BSD support yet, since I want to set it up by installing BSD on my pc but right now there is no ethernet which makes installing BSD almost impossible! In the comming months we will be moving into a new house where i will be able to get ethernet!
